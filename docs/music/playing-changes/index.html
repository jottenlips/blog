<h2 id="Personal-Experiences">Personal Experiences</h2>

<p>I started improvising well before I learned what changes were or how to read music. My first experiences
with improvising were playing boomer bends and licks over I-IV-V blues songs at the Roadhouse in St. Louis.
At the same time, I was jamming over everything from Nirvana to Phish in the back of David&#39;s guitar loft.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was waking up for combos and big band every morning in high school at 0-hour (7 am) before the &quot;real&quot; classes began.
I tried out for both mid-state jazz band and the jazz at the bistro all-stars and failed pretty epically both times.
For the mid-state audition, I failed to get a single note out ðŸ˜…. I was very nervous and terrible at sight-reading.</p>
<p>Somehow, This didn&#39;t stop me from pursuing a musical education.
I got a minor in music at Belmont University and made JB 1 my second year.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, here are some of the important things that got me through it all.</p>
<h2 id="The-theory">The theory</h2>

<p>Modes</p>
<p>| c | d | e | f | g | a | b | Ionian, CMaj7, Major scale
| d | e | f | g | a | b | c | Dorian, Dmin7
| e | f | g | a | b | c | d | Phrygian, Emin7
| f | g | a | b | c | d | e | Lydian, Fmaj7
| g | a | b | c | d | e | f | Mixolydian, G7
| a | b | c | d | e | f | g | Aeolian, Amin7, Minor Scale
| b | c | d | e | f | g | a | Locrian, Bdim</p>
<p>If you skip every other note C, E, G, B etc. you get the chord for that scale.
All of the chords you find in this chart are in the key of C.</p>
<p>A good tune to practice playing your modes over is &quot;So What&quot; by Miles Davis.
This is also an excellent tune to introduce you to changes because it has a half step key change.</p>
<p><hr/>Inversions</p>
<ul><li><p>start with triads (C,E,G) on the first three strings. Learn the inversions for maj, min, aug, dim.</p>
</li><li><p>add the seventh and repeat through all the strings.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>You will be playing chord melodies in no time ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p><hr/>Secondary Dominants</p>
<p>to be continued...</p>

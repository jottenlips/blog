# How to play changes

## Personal Experiences

I started improvising well before I learned what changes were or how to read music. My first experiences
with improvising were playing boomer bends and licks over I-IV-V blues songs at the Roadhouse in St. Louis.
At the same time, I was jamming over everything from Nirvana to Phish in the back of David's guitar loft.

Eventually, I was waking up for combos and big band every morning in high school at 0-hour (7 am) before the "real" classes began.
I tried out for both mid-state jazz band and the jazz at the bistro all-stars and failed pretty epically both times.
For the mid-state audition, I failed to get a single note out ðŸ˜…. I was very nervous and terrible at sight-reading.

Somehow, This didn't stop me from pursuing a musical education.
I got a minor in music at Belmont University and made JB 1 my second year.

With that out of the way, here are some of the important things that got me through it all.

## The theory

Modes

| c | d | e | f | g | a | b | Ionian, CMaj7, Major scale
| d | e | f | g | a | b | c | Dorian, Dmin7
| e | f | g | a | b | c | d | Phrygian, Emin7
| f | g | a | b | c | d | e | Lydian, Fmaj7
| g | a | b | c | d | e | f | Mixolydian, G7
| a | b | c | d | e | f | g | Aeolian, Amin7, Minor Scale
| b | c | d | e | f | g | a | Locrian, Bdim

If you skip every other note C, E, G, B etc. you get the chord for that scale.
All of the chords you find in this chart are in the key of C.

A good tune to practice playing your modes over is "So What" by Miles Davis.
This is also an excellent tune to introduce you to changes because it has a half step key change.

Inversions

- start with triads (C,E,G) on the first three strings. Learn the inversions for maj, min, aug, dim.

- add the seventh and repeat through all the strings.

You will be playing chord melodies in no time ðŸ˜Ž

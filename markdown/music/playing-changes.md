# How to play changes

## Personal Experiences

I started improvising well before I learned what changes were or how to read music. My first experiences
with improvising were playing boomer bends and licks over I-IV-V blues songs at the Roadhouse in St. Louis.
At the same time, I was jamming over everything from Nirvana to Phish in the back of David's guitar loft.

Eventually, I was waking up for combos and big band every morning in high school at 0-hour (7 am) before the "real" classes began.
I tried out for both mid-state jazz band and the jazz at the bistro all-stars and failed pretty epically both times.
For the mid-state audition, I failed to get a single note out ðŸ˜…. I was very nervous and terrible at sight-reading.

Somehow, This didn't stop me from pursuing a musical education.
I got a minor in music at Belmont University and made JB 1 my second year.

With that out of the way, here are some of the important things that got me through it all.

## The theory

Modes

```

| c | d | e | f | g | a | b | Ionian, CMaj7, Major scale
| d | e | f | g | a | b | c | Dorian, Dmin7
| e | f | g | a | b | c | d | Phrygian, Emin7
| f | g | a | b | c | d | e | Lydian, Fmaj7
| g | a | b | c | d | e | f | Mixolydian, G7
| a | b | c | d | e | f | g | Aeolian, Amin7, Minor Scale
| b | c | d | e | f | g | a | Locrian, Bdim
```

If you skip every other note C, E, G, B etc. you get the chord for that scale.
All of the chords you find in this chart are in the key of C.

A good tune to practice playing your modes over is "So What" by Miles Davis.
This is also an excellent tune to introduce you to changes because it has a half step key change.

Inversions

- start with triads (C,E,G) on the first three strings (guitar). Learn the inversions for maj, min, aug, dim.

- add the seventh and repeat through all the strings.

You will be playing chord melodies in no time ðŸ˜Ž

Scale degrees and Extensions

You can label every note in the key of C as scale degrees.

```

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| c | d | e | f | g | a | b |
```

Extensions typically go from 9 to 13

9 is the second note of the scale played an octave up
11 is the fourth an octave up
13 is the 6th played an octave up

```

|   | 9 |   | 11 |   | 13 |   |
| c | d | e | f  | g | a  | b |
```

You can add these extensions to c hords for extra color.

These extensions are a continuation of the every other note pattern that makes the base chords like CMaj7.

This pattern is how you get chords like CMaj9.

```

| c |   | e |   | g |   | b |  | d (octave up) | CMaj9
```

Secondary Dominants

Secondary dominants are chords used to change keys in a lot of tunes.
These are dominant 7 chords that voice-lead to the new key. It is typically the 5th
of the new key. For example, G7 leads to CMaj. Seven chords have a gravitational force that
pulls you to the new key. What helps the changes sound smooth is playing the compatible
extensions on these dominant chords.

What this chart means by III7 is if the third chord in a key is a dominant seventh chord instead
of what the listener is expecting (min7) play the notes in the dominant 7 triad with the extensions provided.

In C, instead of getting Emin7 (third chord of C Maj)
they get an E7. The notes you would want to play over E7 in this case are:

```
(E, G#, B, D) with extensions of (F [b9], G [#9], A, [11], Bb [b13])
```

and E7 will most likely resolve to AMaj, our new key center.

Try jamming over these changes:

```
Dmin7 | G7 | CMaj7 | Bmin | E7 | AMaj7
```

You have successfully gone from CMaj to Amaj! ðŸŽ‰

Try making other chord progressions with differnt scale degrees as the secondary dominant.

The pattern above is called a ii-V-I and is very common in jazz.

```

III7 VI7 VII7
sound: "Altered"
extenions: [b9, #9, 11, b13]
```

```

bII bIII7 bVI7 bVII7
sound: "Lydian Dominant"
extension [9, #11, 13]
```

```

II7 IV7
sound: "Mixolydian" / "Lydian Dominant"
extension [9, 11/#11, 13]
```

```

bV7
sound: "Whole Tone"
extensions: [9, #11, b13]
```

```

V7 (not the secondary dominant, really depends on the tune)
sound: "Rainbow"
extensions: [b9, 9, #9, 11, #11, b13, 13]
```

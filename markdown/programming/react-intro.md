# Let's start a front-end web project.

ðŸ›  Tools you will be adding to your repertoire:

- Git

- React

## Install Git, it comes with xcode on macos

```
xcode -select--install
```

## Create a react app named my-app

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

## install dependencies

```
npm i
```

## run your app

```
npm start
```

Now that you have your first app running, let's make a simple app using react hooks. Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" a components state or life-cycle. In this case, we can replace the functional component create react app gives us with our own. Ours will have a hook for the count and a button to increment the count.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
const { useState } = React;
// We can use an arrow function here as well.
// In react you create apps from components.
// These components can be functions as seen below
// Entire apps can be composed of "functional components"
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p> {count} </p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>increment count </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```javascript
// Here is an example of a react app using hooks that tells you the fifth of any note.

// App.jsx
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { getFifth } from "./getFifth";
const { useState } = React;
const App = () => {
  const [fifth, setFifth] = useState("");
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p> Fifth: {fifth} </p>
      <input onChange={(e) => setFifth(getFifth(e.target.value))} />
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```

```
// getFifth.js
export const getFifth = (note) => {
  console.log(note);
  if (!note) {
    return "";
  }
  const lowerCaseNote = note.toLowerCase();
  const fifth = {
    c: "g",
    g: "d",
    d: "a",
    a: "e",
    e: "b",
    b: "f#",
    "f#": "c#",
    gb: "db",
    "c#": "ab",
    db: "ab",
    ab: "eb",
    eb: "bb",
    bb: "f",
    f: "c",
  }[lowerCaseNote];
  if (!fifth) {
    return "";
  }
  const formattedNote = `${fifth.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}${fifth.slice(1)}`;
  return formattedNote;
};
```

Try to make an app for making a list of groceries, chores, mood-board, or something simple.

Hint: You can use useState with other data types like arrays and objects.

```
const [groceries, setGroceries] = useState([])
```

You can also "spread" old items with a new item to make a new array with all of the items. ... is the spread operator.

```
setGroceries([...groceries, newGroceryItem])
```

Once you are happy with your app. Let's make sure your code is under version control for future updates and collaboration with other developers using Git. First sign-up or login to Github, https: //github.com/. Make a new repository for my-app.

```
## cd to your project
git init # initialize a git repo in your project
git checkout -b main

# add the remote to your local git repo

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-app

# make a .gitignore
touch .gitignore

# ignore your node_modules by adding node_modules to this file
echo node_modules >> .gitignore

# add your code to the staging area
git add --all

# commit your changes
git commit -m"initial commit"

# push your changes to Github
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Congrats! You developed your first front-end project and put it under source control!

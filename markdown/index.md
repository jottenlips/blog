## Feeling generous? 

Here are a few of my favorite charities.

This February, I am climbing a mile for Paradox Sports at Climb Nashville. You can [Donate to Paradox Sports](https://paradoxsports.salsalabs.org/paradoxmileclimbnashville2023/p/johnottenlipsfranke/index.html) through my page. Last February, we hit the goal. Let's do it again this year!

[Donate to OXFAM](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/donate/)

This blog was generated via [agave](https://github.com/jottenlips/agave), a static site generator I wrote with ReasonML that turns markdown files (.md) into custom styled html and css.

```bash
npm i -g agave-generator
# for theming your own site
mkdir markdown
cd markdown
echo '<html><body><!-- MARKDOWN --></body></html>' >> base.html
touch index.md && touch styles.css
cd ..
agave -p docs
```

And push to your GitHub io page, or upload to any other static site hosting service.

For code syntax highlighting, I am using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) in my base.html file.

This blog and open source code require a lot of caffeine.

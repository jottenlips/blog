This blog was generated via [agave](https://github.com/jottenlips/agave), a static site generator I wrote with ReasonML that turns markdown files (.md) into custom styled html and css.

```bash
npm i -g agave-generator
# for theming your own site
mkdir markdown
cd markdown
echo '<html><body><!-- MARKDOWN --></body></html>' >> base.html
touch index.md && touch styles.css
cd ..
agave -p docs
```

And push to your GitHub io page, or upload to any other static site hosting service.

For code syntax highlighting, I am using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) in my base.html file.
